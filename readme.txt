Welcome to BrowserML!

This is an open-source project that aims to put the power of ML in the hands of everyone

To get started, upload a structured dataset. Then pick the variable you want to predict (dependent variable), 
and the variables you think will impact it (independent variables). Finally, press the button corresponding
to the model you want to train. Once done, you will see the results of your model, will be able to download it,
or use it to make new prediction right in the browser.
